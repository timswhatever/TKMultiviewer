# TKMultiviewer

View (almost) unlimited streams for both Twitch and Kick, at the same time.

Small project I occasionally update, still learning JS and CSS. Definitely not the best it could be.
If you want to see 7tv, betterTTV, and frankerfaceZ emotes in chat, I recommend installing betterTTV and enabling emotes from all of those platforms.

To-do:
- [x] Chat box
- [ ] Improve Chat
- [ ] Improve themes
- [ ] Better name
- [ ] Improve kick embeds
- [x] More than 4 streams
